I still have a ton in this template to clean up, but I wanted to get something out there. Once again I'm restarting this experiment. However, right now I'm starting simple again. I'm taking the VuePress blog theme, and going from there. Hopefully starting simple, and remembering to increment a little at a time will help that.

I need to choose a platform, and move on. Build from what I have.
